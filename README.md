# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

Customer churn threatens revenue stability and growth in the telecommunications industry. This study compares several machine learning algorithms for predicting customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. 

The dataset includes customer demographics, service subscriptions, contract details, billing information, and churn data. Five classification models are implemented: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and a feedforward Neural Network. After cleaning the data, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and creating a stratified train-test split, the modelAs performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, along with confusion matrices to give more insight into misclassification patterns. 

The results show that the Logistic Regression model achieves the best overall performance with an accuracy of 78.7%, especially in identifying churners, while Random Forest highlights the importance of features such as Total Charges, Monthly Charges, Tenure etc. These findings show how machine learning can help support proactive retention strategies by enabling targeted actions for at-risk customers. The study also points out several promising areas for future research. These include using deep learning models like recurrent and feedforward neural networks; applying oversampling techniques such as SMOTE to fix class imbalance; systematic tuning of hyperparameters and feature engineering; incorporating time-series data and customer behavior logs; integrating customer satisfaction survey data; and using model interpretation methods like SHAP and LIME to better understand churn drivers.
